My thesis investigates the possibilities of increasing the energy efficiency of an access point using the WiFi standards 802.11 b/a/g/n/ac with their respective bandwidths.
An experiment was conducted to establish the power consumption of an Archer C7 AC1750 access point. Next to this, three simulations were performed extrapolating the data gathered from the experiment. This was done to get insight in to the energy consumption of the access point over the period of a month.
The experiment performed shows that the b, a and g standards draw less power compared to the their 2.4GHz and 5GHz counter parts but due to a longer transmission time the total consumed amount of energy is significantly larger.
Moreover, all 2.4GHz networks have a similar idle power draw and within the 5GHz category two groups are seen a and n with a 20MHz, and the remaining standards.
The first two simulations showed that 802.11n with a 20MHz bandwidth consumes the least amount of energy within a month. However, 802.11ac with a 80MHz bandwidth becomes the least consuming standard when the network is turned off when it is not in use.
The final simulation shows roughly an 23% decrease in energy consumption of the access point when switching between two standards.
Based on the results of the simulation, the most energy efficient standard is 2.4GHz 802.11n at a 20MHz bandwidth. 
Next to this, standard switching has shown to significantly reduce the energy consumption. The same holds for a wake/sleep solution.
